So when #tryandreview sent me a bottle of L’Oréal 3in1 extraordinary oil I couldn’t wait to try it and see its effects. I’d been looking for a hair treatment that I could use on dry hair before shampoo and had trouble finding one. So when I read that this could be used before shampoo to me this product had already won half the battle. I worked 10pumps of oil through my hair and left it in for about 15mins before shampooing it out. I applied another 2 more pumps after towel drying. The results was that my hair definitely felt softer though it didn’t do much for my frizz. But the comb definitely made its way through a lot easier.     The bottle design doesn’t really help in the pumping of the oil because you have to lift it up and angle it so that it doesn’t trickle down the sides. So if you have already worked the oil through your hair the first time to pump Loren product you’ll have to pick up the bottle with oily hands or risk coating the bottle with more oil.,Volume (ml):100,5,28 Jun 2018

Usually, I don’t apply hair serum/oil to wet hair because most of the time before the product can successfully absorb by the hair, the water from my hair will transfer onto my hands first and I’ll get this greasy oil-water texture on my palm, which I hate.

Will definitely recommend this product to my friends and family!,Volume (ml):150,0,19 Aug 2019

The results after drying the hair tends to be smooth and manageable but only for the first few hours.When i received the L'Oreal Paris Elseve Rapid Revivers Conditioner the first best thing was that there is no Leave In time required and you could just wash it off after applying it through your hair. The 2nd best thing is that this magic lasted through out 2 days keeping the Hair Smooth Manageable and there were absolutely NO TANGLES !!Moreover this is a daily usable treatment for those who washes hair everyday.I,Volume (ml):150,0,19 Aug 2019
374,l-oreal-paris,Hair Conditioner,L'Oreal Paris Extraordinary Oil Rapid Reviver Conditioner,$7.92,So what are my thoughts on the L'oreal Rapid Reviver Deep Conditioner? I think it's a nice conditioner for people with damaged short to middle length hair. For me ( a person with long damaged wavy hair) it did feel moisturizing and softening but after 2 days I noticed that nothing had really been repaired. My hair had simply been slightly moisturized and even that feeling went away soon after using it. If you have short or middle length hair this might be amazing for you and for the affordable price I do recommend it to you. However if your hair is long I strongly suggest you go silicone free with all your hair care,Volume (ml):150,0,19 Aug 2019

380,l-oreal-paris,Hair Conditioner,L'Oreal Paris Fall Repair Rapid Reviver Conditioner,$7.92,I’ve always been obsessed with hair conditioners and always keen to try new products to keep my crown looking smooth and shiny.  I used the L’OREAL PARIS FALL RESIST X3 RAPID REVIVER for a week and to my experience my hair became smooth and glossy after use without the greasy effect (and lo and behold it has no leave on time which makes it easy and fast).  Though one of my major concerns is to fight hair fall which I find this product good to try on. And I think it has minimized my hair fall but only to about 10-20% less. Maybe it may require longer usage of the product to reap its benefits to what I’m expecting.

The lotion instantly hydrated my skin upon application.  Floral fragrant smell is nice with slightly thicker than water feel, takes a while to absorb into the skin and still leave slight sticky feeling even after padding but it's acceptable to me.  However it does not help to maintain the moisture long enough for me especially during the day as I have very dry skin condition.  Not as  effective for mature dry skin if you want to see immediate result.  But I am willing to continue using it and see if it does improve my dry skin condition after finishing the bottle.

A lightweight and non-greasy product that was v lightly fragranced.   My skin is both dehydrated and sensitive and I was initially worried that I might break out from using a new product or that this product would not be hydrating enough.   Both my fears were unfounded. I appreciated how quickly this product was absorbed into my skin, though I used 7-8 drops, more than the recommended 4-5 drops. A little really goes a long way- in the first three days, my face suffer from minor breakouts caused by using over 10 drops of the product each time. Once I decreased the amount, it was fine.     I used a magnifying mirror to examine my face before and after my skincare routinely and I’m pleased to discover that the fine lines looked less obvious with my skin looking more plumped up.

653,l-oreal-paris,Face Treatments Serums,L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Crystal Micro-Essence Water 130ml,$26.93,Firstly the product contains a fragrance which I wouldn't usually recommend on a skincare item due to people with fragrance sensitivities but it's mild and pleasant. After 7 days of usage during daytime and night-time I did not see any obvious improvement to my complexion. I have acne-prone skin so at least the good thing is that there were no flare ups or reactions. It does make your skin feel smoother though and the consistency is incredibly light and watery and once on skin feels almost as if you applied a thin layer of lotion. I'm glad to have gotten to try it out and I hope my review helps those with the same skin ailments.

It is however rather harsh on hair, and made my hair look very dry the entire day. The color transfers easily, making it easy to wash off. However, it also means the color easily stained the shirt I was wearing.     I would recommend this product only to those who are unwilling to commit to a new hair color without first trying it out. Perhaps if the color did not transfer so easily, the product would be a lot better.",Purchase Product not stated,3,28 Mar 2018

1165,l-oreal-paris,Hair Coloring,Colorista 1 Day Spray 75ml - by L'Oréal Paris,$16.90,"The colour pay off is really visible on dark hair, The application is relatively easy, a lesson I learned, never spray with a fan blowing as the colour will spread across the room. LOL! This product is great for that one special night out with friends, but not recommended for daily use. As the warning says on the product, like makeup, it is transferable and I cant stress how true it is! Great warning! :)     A little downside:  The spray acts as a normal hair spray as well so do not expect soft silky hair after spraying. Try not to wear light clothing as the colour may transfer to your clothes, especially for those who sprayed the ends of the hair to get an ombre effect. It takes quite a number of wash to fully get the product off.     Overall, once you get the hang of styling your hair with the product, this is a great tool to use.

The colour payoff nicely, and is quite lasting.   However, i find it a little bit hard to apply by myself, it will look messy and not so nice with colours lighter in some part of hair, or more concentrate in another part of hair, which in the end, my hair look abit disappointing, but it may be because that i didnt know how to use it properly. One more thing is that, it is very easiler to tranfer if the coloured hair got wet, which is a good and bad thing, good thing is that, we can wash off easily, bad thing is that must be extra careful to not get it wet, which also means cannot apply it when its raining outside.

Oily on the forehead,side of nose and dry on the cheek  4. Acne scars and blemishes    Previously I was using Maybelline Fitme before I received the free product from Try&Review. Thus, I would write this review in comparison to another drugstore matt poreless foundation Maybelline FITME.    After I have tried this Loreal foundation, I must say that I love it.  1. It is plastic light packing,easy to carry while Maybelline FITME is glass and heavy, I always needed handle the bottle with extra care.  2.  Squeezing the Loreal Foundation from the tube packing is easier to control than pouring out from the Maybelline glass bottle which often overflow. In addition to that, FITME often carelessly/accidentally pour out the foundation liquid when you tilt the bottle on the table.  3. Loreal's does not dry out my nose and mouth area while Maybelline FITME makes my look flaky, I often need to focus on my moisturizing process before I put on Maybelline's.  4. Despite Maybelline FITME has different skin shades, none of them fit perfectly to my skin tone. I am using shade 102 for Loreal and it fits perfectly.  5. Loreal's has higher coverage and the coverage is build-able. The photo shows my face after the first layer of the foundation. Usually I will use second layers on those prone areas, it works better than some concealers out there.    p.s I did not put any primers and skin care products in the photo, only blend the Loreal foundation with the beauty blender.",Color:103 - Natural Buff,5,02 Apr 2018

This shade had a slightly orange undertone which I was not excited about. Despite this, I decided to try out the product anyway to test out exactly how good the product was.    This foundation was very very smooth when I had applied it on. The formula provided coverage, yet it felt light and wasn't cakey. It was matte, yet you could still see the natural glow on your face, which was extraordinary as I had never had my hands on something so amazing. The foundation also didn't feel like it was drying out your face just because it was matte. After setting my face with translucent powder from Laura Mercier, as well as Urban Decay's setting spray, I headed out for my day of fun.    As the day passed, I realised I didn't even have to put more translucent powder as the foundation was amazing with oil control.

It was so smooth and light that I didn’t even felt like I had foundation on. The medium coverage foundation helped to cover my acne scars and dark circles which I usually use a concealer to cover. In that aspect, the coverage for this foundation is really good. To finish off the whole look, I dabbed some loose powder, eyeliner, mascara, lipstick and blusher. (That’s what I normally apply when heading to work - with concealer). Having the thought of one less product to use on my face makes me a happy person.

1265,l-oreal-paris,Foundation,Infallible Pro-Matte Liquid Foundation (24H Long Wear) by L'Oréal Paris,$23.90,"Been using this for almost a week now, for both my gig and work.    Ease of application: 8/10  The consistency of this foundation is described on the packaging as 'creamy', but I for one feel that it is a lot more fluid, and the consistency is very similar to that of Lancôme's Absolue Foundation, which is close to watery, making it easy to apply, and it dries fast as well. After putting it on, it felt like I was wearing nothing on my face, because of how thin the foundation is. The duration of applying the product is very quick as it's really thin and glides on easily to the skin.   Coverage: 9/10  For such a thin foundation, the coverage is actually really high. It can cover up pores and also acne redness (still a good idea to use a colour corrector primer before using the foundation tho, I used W7's Green Prime Magic to neutralise my acne redness). And also, the coverage is also buildable. But do not expect this foundation alone to cover up moles or any dark brown spots on the face. Would be better to layer on some concealer on moles.   Lasting ability: 7/10  I myself have oily skin, and by midday during work (5-6 hours after applying), the foundation has almost melted off completely, which is kinda expected. Doing a touch up with more foundation will only decrease the existing tints life span, so try not to do touchup with this foundation. So for users with oily skin or combination skin, please don't expect this foundation to stay on your face the whole day.  For dry skin users, you won't have to worry about the foundation melting off, but then again, it is a matte finish foundation, so it's already pretty dry. Try to get a hydrating foundation instead.    Is it worth the price? For one 30ml tube of foundation that costs $29.90, it's quite a good deal. It has medium to high coverage, and is such a thin matte foundation. Ruling out the average lasting ability on oily skin users, this foundation is actually a good steal.    #FaceOfTheDay",Color:103 - Natural Buff,4,26 Mar 2018

Did not feel that it lasted for 16 hours as claimed; definitely needs touch up, especially when you get warm or sweaty.

Design is very compact and lightweight. Comes with mirror. 

The only downside for me is the puff. Other than being able to apply the powder as per normal and it is soft, the design of the puff looks like those once off disposable ones.  Thus it makes me doubt the quality and durability. I feel it didn't matched the brand image and hope it can be improved.

I love how the powder creates a natural look and the best part? It does not give the scary cakey look! Its ultra-fine texture blends into my BB cream seamlessly and creates a poreless and porcelain alike skin. The powder does a great job in keeping my make up in place for long hours.

It was safely delivered to me days ago. *Thank you Garnier!*    I was so eager to try coz firstly, it mentioned that its removal for light makeup (which i am. I have been a light makeup for 3years now. Before that i used to have heavy makeup on).  Secondly, it mentioned its for sensitive skin. I have this sensitivity issue under my eyes & nose area, for years now. Yesterday night, tried and tested. And IM LOVING IT! I don't feel the tingling heaty on my sensitive areas though. And best best, after removing it, you can just straightaway go to bed. Really! No need to rinse after removing. Wow Garnier. I have used other brand, which is have been my fave. But that particular brand when i have used, the sticky feeling exist, so i have to rinse to get rid of the feeling ok my face. For garnier, its not though. Amazing!

2797,garnier,Makeup Removers,[Essential Micellar Set] Garnier Micellar Water Pink (For Sensitive Skin),$23.80,"Yesterday night was my first try from Garnier brand. It was safely delivered to me days ago. *Thank you Garnier!*    I was so eager to try coz firstly, it mentioned that its removal for light makeup (which i am. I have been a light makeup for 3years now. Before that i used to have heavy makeup on).  Secondly, it mentioned its for sensitive skin. I have this sensitivity issue under my eyes & nose area, for years now. Yesterday night, tried and tested. And IM LOVING IT! I don't feel the tingling heaty on my sensitive areas though. And best best, after removing it, you can just straightaway go to bed. Really! No need to rinse after removing. Wow Garnier. I have used other brand, which is have been my fave. But that particular brand when i have used, the sticky feeling exist, so i have to rinse to get rid of the feeling ok my face. For garnier, its not though. Amazing! Garnier MW, you are on my fave list now! THANK YOU #GARNIERSG for sending over to me to try. Love it!",Volume (ml):400,5,03 Jun 2018

2799,garnier,Makeup Removers,[Essential Micellar Set] Garnier Micellar Water Pink (For Sensitive Skin),$23.80,"Indeed, used only 1 cotton pad to remove my make up for the entire face. I feel refreshed and it feels like I already washed my face with a soap.    For the packaging, I prefer smaller size since expiration is just for 6M. And for the 400ml for 6M is too much as you only need a bit amount to remove makeup, unless you wear make up every single day. And it is quite pricey compare to other micellar cleansing water.",Volume (ml):400,4,03 Jun 2018
